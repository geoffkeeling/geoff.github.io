I am a Research Scientist at Google. I work on machine learning ethics. Before Google, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). 

[Here](https://geoffkeeling.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.
