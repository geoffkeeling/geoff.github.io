I'm a philosopher at Google. I work on the bioethics program at [Google Health](https://health.google/). I work mostly on the ethics of AI. But I have broad interests across moral and political philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of science. Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). Before that, I completed a PhD in philosophy at the University of Bristol, supervised by [Richard Pettigrew](https://richardpettigrew.com/) and [Brad Hooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hooker). I also worked as a research assistant on the [Understanding Medical Black Boxes](http://lcfi.ac.uk/projects/ai-trust-and-society/medical-black-boxes-and-ai-explainability/) project at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](https://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge. 

[Here](https://geoffkeeling.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.
