I am a senior research scientist at Google. I work on machine learning ethics. Previously, I was a bioethicist at [Google Health](https://health.google/). Before Google, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). I also spent time at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge.
