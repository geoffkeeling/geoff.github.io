I am a Research Scientist at Google. I work mostly on machine learning ethics. But I have broad interests across moral and political philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of the biological and cognitive sciences. Previously, I was a Bioethicist at [Google Health](https://health.google/). Before that, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/).

[Here](https://geoffkeeling.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.
