I'm a philosopher at Google. I work on the bioethics program at [Google Health](https://health.google/). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). Before that, I was a Research Assistant on the Understanding Medical Black Boxes project at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. I work mostly in the ethics of AI. But I'm also interested in moral and political philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of science.
