I am a research scientist at Google. I work on machine learning ethics. My background is philosophy. My broader interests are in moral philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of the biological and cognitive sciences. Before Google, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). [Here](https://geoffkeeling.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.
