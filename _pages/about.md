I am a Research Scientist at Google. I work on machine learning ethics. My background is philosophy. My broader interests are in moral philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of the biological and cognitive sciences. Previously, I was a Bioethicist at [Google Health](https://health.google). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University, based in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). 

I completed my PhD in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Bristol in 2020. My [thesis](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/243368588/Pure_Thesis.pdf) was on the ethics of automated vehicles. I was supervised by [Richard Pettigrew](https://richardpettigrew.com/) and [Brad Hooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hooker). During my PhD I also worked as a Research Assistant to [Rune Nyrup](https://sites.google.com/view/runenyrup/home?pli=1) at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](https://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge.

[Here](https://geoffkeeling.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.
