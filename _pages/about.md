I'm a philosopher at Google. I work on the bioethics program at [Google Health](https://health.google/). Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). There I taught a course on the Ethics, Law and Politics of AI and co-led the AI safety group for the [Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258) paper. Before Stanford, I was a Research Assistant on the Understanding Medical Black Boxes project at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. 

I work mostly in the ethics of AI. But I have broad interests across moral and political philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of science.

In 2020, I completed an Arts and Humanities Research Council funded PhD in Philosophy from the University of Bristol, supervised by Richard Pettigrew and Brad Hooker. I also have an MA in Philosophy from Bristol and a BSc in Philosophy, Logic, and Scientific Method from the London School of Economics. I have consulted on AI ethics for the UK Law Commission, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, and the Centre for Connected and Automated Vehicles. 

I previously served as President of the [British Postgraduate Philosophy Association](https://bippa.uk/) and on the Executive Committee of the [British Philosophical Association](https://bpa.ac.uk/). I am a Fellow of the [Royal Society of Arts](https://www.thersa.org/) and a Member of the [Aristotelian Society](https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/). Please consider supporting these organizations.
