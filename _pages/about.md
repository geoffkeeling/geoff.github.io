I am a research scientist at Google. I work on machine learning ethics. My background is philosophy. My broader interests are in moral philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of the biological and cognitive sciences. Before Google, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). [Here](https://geoffkeeling.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.

I am a Research Scientist at Google. My background is philosophy. I work on machine learning ethics. Right now Iâ€™m looking at language model cognition and what if anything the cognitive capabilities of language models imply about their moral standing and how we should relate to them socially. But I have broad interests across applied ethics, moral philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of the biological and cognitive sciences. I also spend some time on ethics education and culture change at Google. Previously, I was a Bioethicist over at [Google Health](https://health.google/). Before Google, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University, based in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). I also spent some time at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](https://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge.
