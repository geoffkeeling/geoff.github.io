I'm a philosopher at Google. I work on the bioethics program at [Google Health](https://health.google/). I work mostly on the ethics of AI. But I have broad interests across moral and political philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of science. Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). Before that, I worked as a research assistant on the [Understanding Medical Black Boxes](http://lcfi.ac.uk/projects/ai-trust-and-society/medical-black-boxes-and-ai-explainability/) project at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](https://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge. 

I completed an Arts and Humanities Research Council funded PhD in philosophy at the University of Bristol in 2020, supervised by [Richard Pettigrew](https://richardpettigrew.com/) and [Brad Hooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hooker). Before that, I got my MA in Philosophy from Bristol in 2017 and my BSc in Philosophy, Logic, and Scientific Method from the London School of Economics in 2016. 

I have advised the UK Law Commission, the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation on AI ethics and policy. I served as President of the [British Postgraduate Philosophy Association](https://bippa.uk/) and on the Executive Committee of the [British Philosophical Association](https://bpa.ac.uk/) from 2018-2019. I am also a Fellow of the [Royal Society of Arts](https://www.thersa.org/) and a [Member of the Aristotelian Society](https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/).
