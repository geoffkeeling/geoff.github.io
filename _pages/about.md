I'm a philosopher at Google. I work on the bioethics program at [Google Health](https://health.google/). Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). I work mostly in the ethics of AI. But I'm also interested in moral and political philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of science.

I previously served as President of the [British Postgraduate Philosophy Association](https://bippa.uk/) and on the Executive Committee of the [British Philosophical Association](https://bpa.ac.uk/). I am a Fellow of the [Royal Society of Arts](https://www.thersa.org/) and a Member of the [Aristotelian Society](https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/). Please consider supporting these organizations.
