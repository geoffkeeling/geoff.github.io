I'm a philosopher at Google. I work on the bioethics program at [Google Health](https://health.google/). I work mostly on the ethics of AI. But I have broad interests across moral and political philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of science. Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). Before that, I completed a PhD in philosophy at the University of Bristol, supervised by [Richard Pettigrew](https://richardpettigrew.com/) and [Brad Hooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hooker). I also worked as a research assistant on the [Understanding Medical Black Boxes](http://lcfi.ac.uk/projects/ai-trust-and-society/medical-black-boxes-and-ai-explainability/) project at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](https://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge. 

For a philosopher Iâ€™m reasonably practical. I've advised the UK Law Commission, the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation on AI ethics and policy. I've refereed for AI conferences such as ACM FAccT and NeurIPS, alongside scientific journals such as Nature. And I co-led the AI safety team for the [Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258) paper at Stanford. I also tend to work on applied questions including how autonomous vehicles should behave when [uncertain about the classification of objects](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Oc-AEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA41&ots=Yb2o_UeiCt&sig=eKqc2hlJv6yIRX_5ojQ7lsrgLxs#v=onepage&q&f=false) and how we should think about [algorithmic fairness in medicine](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09658-7). That said, I sometimes dabble in the [metaphysics of functions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-022-09850-5) and formal models of [how normative reasons accrue](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/economics-and-philosophy/article/abs/dilemma-for-reasons-additivity/5C0CA654E9AD3954FC228D4ABFCCBAA8). Eeek!

I served as President of the [British Postgraduate Philosophy Association](https://bippa.uk/) and on the Executive Committee of the [British Philosophical Association](https://bpa.ac.uk/) from 2018-2019. I am also a Fellow of the [Royal Society of Arts](https://www.thersa.org/) and a [Member of the Aristotelian Society](https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/).
