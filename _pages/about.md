I'm a philosopher at Google. I work on the bioethics program at [Google Health](https://health.google/). I work mostly on the ethics of AI. But I have broad interests across moral and political philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of science. Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). 

I am a Fellow of the [Royal Society of Arts](https://www.thersa.org/) and a Member of the [Aristotelian Society](https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/). Please consider supporting these organizations.

[Here](https://geoffkeeling.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.
