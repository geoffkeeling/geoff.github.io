I am a Research Scientist at Google. I work on machine learning ethics. Previously, I was a Bioethicist at [Google Health](https://health.google/). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). I completed my PhD on [autonomous vehicle ethics](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/243368588/Pure_Thesis.pdf) in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Bristol in 2020, supervised by [Richard Pettigrew](https://richardpettigrew.com/) and [Brad Hooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hooker). I also worked as a research assistant on the [Understanding Medical Black Boxes](http://lcfi.ac.uk/projects/ai-trust-and-society/medical-black-boxes-and-ai-explainability/) project at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](https://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge.
