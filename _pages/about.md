I am a research scientist at Google. I work on machine learning ethics. But I have broad research interests across moral philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of the biology and cognitive science. I also work on ethics education and culture change at Google. Previously, I was a Bioethicist at [Google Health](https://health.google/). Before Google, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). I also spent some time at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](https://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge.
