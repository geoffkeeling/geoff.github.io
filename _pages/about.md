I am a Research Scientist at Google. I work on machine learning ethics. My background is philosophy. My broader interests are in moral philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of the biological and cognitive sciences. Before Google, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). I got my PhD in philosophy at the University of Bristol in 2020. My [thesis](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/243368588/Pure_Thesis.pdf) was on automated vehicle ethics. I was supervised by [Richard Pettigrew](https://richardpettigrew.com/) and [Brad Hooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hooker). Back then I also worked as a Research Assistant at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](https://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge.
