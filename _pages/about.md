I'm a philosopher at Google. I work on the bioethics program. Previously, I was a research fellow at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). Most of my work is in the ethics of AI. But I'm also interested in moral and political philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of science.
