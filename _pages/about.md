I'm a philosopher at Google. I work on the bioethics program at [Google Health](https://health.google/). I work mostly on the ethics of AI. But I have broad interests across moral and political philosophy, decision theory, and philosophy of science. Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). Before that, I completed a PhD in philosophy at the University of Bristol, supervised by [Richard Pettigrew](https://richardpettigrew.com/) and [Brad Hooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hooker). I also worked as a research assistant on the [Understanding Medical Black Boxes](http://lcfi.ac.uk/projects/ai-trust-and-society/medical-black-boxes-and-ai-explainability/) project at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](https://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge. 

For a philosopher Iâ€™m reasonably practical. I have advised the UK [Law Commission](https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/), the [Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/centre-for-connected-and-autonomous-vehicles), and the [Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/centre-for-data-ethics-and-innovation) on AI policy. I have refereed for AI conferences such as [ACM FAccT](https://facctconference.org/) and [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), alongside scientific journals such as [Nature](https://www.nature.com/). I also co-led the AI safety team for the [Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258) paper at Stanford. I tend to work on applied ethical questions including [how autonomous vehicles should behave when uncertain about the classification of proximate objects](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Oc-AEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA41&ots=Yb2o_UeiCt&sig=eKqc2hlJv6yIRX_5ojQ7lsrgLxs#v=onepage&q&f=false) and [how we should think about algorithmic fairness in clinical medicine](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09658-7).

I have advised the UK Law Commission, the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation on AI ethics and policy. I served as President of the [British Postgraduate Philosophy Association](https://bippa.uk/) and on the Executive Committee of the [British Philosophical Association](https://bpa.ac.uk/) from 2018-2019. I am also a Fellow of the [Royal Society of Arts](https://www.thersa.org/) and a [Member of the Aristotelian Society](https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/).
